# CLAUDE-IOS.md

The rules for the iOS side of the project. They are part of [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which holds
the rules both platforms share and loads this file.

## Building for iOS on this machine

- Kotlin/Native compiles the iOS targets on this Windows machine. Nothing is linked here and
  nothing runs here.
- Every link task reports `SKIPPED`, and the build still ends with `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Read the
  task's own line, never the last one.
- The local iOS check is these five tasks, run from the root:

  ```
  ./gradlew compileKotlinIosArm64 compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64 \
    compileTestKotlinIosSimulatorArm64 compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata \
    compileIosMainKotlinMetadata
  ```

- `compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` compiles the shared code as metadata. It catches an error
  the IDE shows in `commonMain` and no target compile does.
- Run the check on every task that touches `commonMain`, `iosMain` or a build file.
- `DiAppComponent` in the `iosMain` of `core-kmp:di-app` is the iOS dependency graph. Its
  compiling is the proof that every iOS binding wires together.

## The framework

- One iOS framework exists, `Shared`. `:core-kmp:di-app` links it, since it sits above every
  other module.
- No other module declares a framework. A second one would bring a second copy of the Kotlin
  runtime and of the shared state.
- `core-kmp:di-app` applies the Compose plugins for the framework's sake. Compose copies the
  resources of the modules below into an app bundle through the module that links it.
- The Compose compiler is switched on for the native targets only in that module. On Android it
  would change the DI classes, and with them what R8 produces. Keep the restriction.

## Versions

- Every iOS version lives in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, under the iOS headers.
- `iosApp/Configuration/Version.xcconfig` is generated from the catalog by
  `./gradlew generateIosVersionXcconfig`. Every Android build runs that task too.
- Never edit the file by hand. Commit a version change together with the regenerated file.
